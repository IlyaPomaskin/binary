# binary-dsl

This library is a high performance binary parser combinator. It enables reading and writing arbitrary binary data from Java's io streams.  

It is inspired by [Lamina](https://github.com/ztellman/lamina) but focuses on java's stream classes. The individual codecs do not require explicit knowledge about the length of data that needs to be read.

### Note
All functions given in this document refer to the namespace `org.clojars.smee.binary.core` (needs to be `require`d or `use` in your namespace declaration).

## Examples / Demo

Please refer to the [tests](https://github.com/smee/binary/blob/master/test/org/clojars/smee/binary/codectests.clj) for now or the start of an [MP3 IDv2 parser](https://github.com/smee/binary/blob/master/src/org/clojars/smee/binary/demo/mp3.clj).
Another demonstration is the [bitcoin block chain parser](https://github.com/smee/binary/blob/master/src/org/clojars/smee/binary/demo/bitcoin.clj)

## Codec
To read binary data we need two things: A `codec` that knows how to read and write it's binary representation and convert it to a clojure data structure and an instance of `java.io.InputStream`. 
The codec needs to satisfy the protocol `BinaryIO` (see [here](https://github.com/smee/binary/blob/master/src/org/clojars/smee/binary/core.clj#L6 "here")).

Each codec can have two attached functions: 

- `pre-encode` - to convert clojure data to something that can be written to binary
- `post-decode` - to convert something read by a codec to a clojure/java data structure

Example: Let's represent an instance of java.util.Date as a unix epoch and write it as a little-endian long:

    (compile-codec :long-le (fn [^java.util.Date date] (.getTime date)) (fn [^long number] (java.util.Date. number))

The compiler hints are not necessary. They are just a clarification in this example.
### API
- `encode` takes an instance of `codec`, a java.util.OutputStream and a value and writes the binary representation of this value into the stream.
- `decode` takes a `codec` and a java.util.InputStream and returns a clojure/java value that was read from the stream. Individual read via `decode` are eager!

### Features/Available codecs
#### Primitives
Encodes primitive data types, either **b**ig-**e**ndian or **l**ittle-**e**ndian:

    :short-le
    :short-be
    :int-le
    :int-be
    :uint-le
    :uint-be
    :long-le
    :long-be
    :float-le
    :float-be
    :double-le
    :double-be

If you use primitive codecs in any way you will **need** to use `compile-codec` to convert it into an instance of `BinaryIO`.
### Sequences
If you want several codecs in a specific order, use a vector:

    [:int-le :float-le :float-le]

### Maps
To name elements in a binary data source maps are ideal. Unfortunately the order of the keys is unspecified. We need to use a map constructor that respects the order of the keys:

    (require '[org.clojars.smee.binary.core :as b])
    (b/ordered-map :foo :int-le :bar [:float-le :double-le])

As you can see arbitrary nesting of codecs is possible. You can define maps of maps of ...

### Repeated
`repeated` uses another `codec` repeatedly until the stream is exhausted. To restrict, how often the `codec` should be used, you can explicitely give one of two parameters: 

- `:length` gives a fixed length. E.g. `(repeated :int-le :length 5)` will try to read/write exactly five little-endian 32bit integers from/to a stream
- `:prefix` takes another codec that will get read/written first. This `codec` contains the length for the successive read/write of the repeated values. Example: `(repeated :int-le :prefix :short-le)` will first read a short and tries then to read as many integers as specified in this short value.
- No parameter will read until exhaustion of the stream.

### String

Reads and writes bytes and converts them from/to strings with a specific string encoding. This codec uses `repeated`, that means it takes either `:length` or `:prefix` as parameter to determine the length of the string.

    (string "ISO-8859-1" :length 3) ; read three bytes, interpret them as a string with encoding "ISO-8859-1"

### Bits
If you have a byte where each bit has a specific meaning you can use a set of keywords as an input.
For example, the following definition says, that the highest bit in a byte gets the value `:a`, the next one `:b`, then `:c`. The bits 4,3, 2 and 1 are ignored, the lowest bit has the value `:last`:

    (bits [:a :b :c nil nil nil nil :last])

If you now read a byte with the value 2r11011001 using this codec you will get the clojure set `#{:a :b:last}` as a value.

### Header
Decodes a header using `header-codec`. Passes this datastructure to `header->body` which returns the codec to use to parse the body. For writing this codec calls `body->header` with the data as parameter and expects a codec to use for writing the header information.

### Padding
Make sure there is always a minimum byte `length` when writing a value.
Per default the padding are 0-bytes. Optionally a third parameter may specify the byte value to use for padding.

### Constant
If a binary format uses fixed elements (like the three bytes 'ID3' in mp3), you can use this codec. It needs a codec and a fixed value. If the value read using this codec does not match the given fixed value, an exception will be thrown.

    (constant (string "ISO-8859-1" :length 3) "ID3")
